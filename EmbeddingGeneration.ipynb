      "Sorry  about  that.  It  on.  Hi,  everyone. Can  I  have  your  attention  for  a  quick  announcement?  Thank  you. My  name  is  Sammy.  I'm  the  field  studies Advisor  here  on  campus  with  Wildland  Studies. And  I'm  here  today  and  tomorrow  to  talk  to  you  guys  about field  study  opportunities  that  we  have offered  in  15  different  locations. Some  of  our  locations  abroad  include Iceland,  Thailand,  Nepal,  Australia. But  we  also  have  some  closer  to  home, like  Yellowstone,  Alaska,  or  Big  Sir,  California. All  of  our  programs  focus  on  core  concepts  in  ecology, wildlife  culture,  and  how  these  concepts  tie  together. And  if  you  were  to  join  us  on  a  program, you  would  get  to  spend  your  quarter  hiking,  camping, snorkeling,  conducting  field  research  while  earning up  to  15  quarter  credits  in  the  upper  division  level. I'm  here  today  because  I  got  to  join Wildlands  as  a  student,  where  in  Hawaii, where  I  got  to  hike  through  volcanic  lava  tubes, snorkel  in  the  coral  reefs, and  learn  about  the  local  efforts  to clean  up  ocean  plastic  pollution. If  you  were  to  join  us  in  Belize,  for  example, you  would  get  to  conduct  research  in  tropical  pine  savannas, explore  tropical  broad  leaf  rainforests, and  conduct  marine  based  research  out  in  the  tropical  keys. Or  if  you  were  to  join  us  in  Nepal, you  would  get  to  camp  amongst  the  highest  peaks  and learn  from  the  locals  about  the  efforts  to  preserve  rhinos, tigers,  and  other  endangered  species. Regardless  of  the  locations  that  you  choose, you'll  be  in  teams  of  eight  to  16  students, all  from  different  universities. You'll  gain  experience  collecting  and  analyzing  data, maintain  detailed  field  journals. All  will  exploring  unique  ecosystems  around  the  world. I  would  love  to  be  able  to  share more  about  these  opportunities  with  you. I'm  hosting  a  student  information  session  tomorrow  at  04:00  P.M. It's  in  the  Plant  and  Environmental  Sciences  Building  Room  2004. I  would  love  to  see  you  there  if  you  can't  make  it. We  also  have  zoom  information  sessions every  Wednesday  at  05:00  P.M.  You  can  find the  link  to  that  on  our  website  at  Wildlands Studies.com  I  have  some  of  these  flyers. I'll  leave  by  either  of  the  doors, you  can  grab  on  your  way  out. But  otherwise,  thank  you  for  letting me  take  a  few  moments  of  your  class  time, and  I  hope  you  have  a  great  rest  of  your  day. There  we  go.  Oh,  thank  you. Thank  Jones. Yeah.  I  don't  know  why  it's  not  focusing. Maybe  he  likes  that  side? Uh,  the  usual. Okay. That  is  this. All  right.  So  I  just  went  by  Dr.  Island's  office  to  see how  the  exam  was going  and  she  was  standing  over  the  copier  scanning. So  we're  still  scanning  the  exams. I'm  hoping  that  by  tonight  we'll  have  all  those  done  and  I  will have  a  chance  to look  at  question  by  question  to  see  how  things  went, if  any  adjustments  need  to  be  made  or  anything  like  that. For  sure,  by  the  time  you  get  in  here  Wednesday, we'll  have  some  scores  posted  and then  there's  some  make  up  exams  I  need  to  give  this  week. People  were  off  on  sports  and  other  things. The  packets  will  be  released  either  through  discussion or  in  the  office  hours  room  next  week. So  you'll  be  able  to  pick  up  your  packet and  take  a  look  at  the  key  and  all  that  good  stuff  to  study  from. Okay,  before  I  get  on  the  next  topic, we're  going  to  transition  a  little  bit  here. We  spent  the  first  few  weeks  talking  about what  biological  systems  are  made  out  of  some  of the  basic  properties  of  the  stuff  of  life. How  we  think  about  interactions between  different  things  that  make  up  biological  systems. We  started  giving  names  to  functional  groups. We  started  recognizing  them. We  started  talking  about  how  do  we communicate  about  whether  a  reaction  goes  or  not,  right? We  talked  about  free  energy and  entropy  and  enthalpy  and  tried  to  get some  just  intuitive  understanding. Hopefully  we're  building  the  intuitive  understanding of  what  some  of  those  things actually  mean  and  how  we  use  them.  I'm  really  excited. Like  this  next  bit  here, we're  going  to  apply  all  that  in  the  context of  most  of  the  next  chunk  of the  course  is  going  to  be  focused  on  metabolism. Which  is  really  looking  at  the  questions  of  as  organisms, whether  you're  a  bacteria, a  human,  the  cat  whale  tree  or  whatever, how  do  we  interact  with  our  environment to  get  the  energy  that  we  need  to  live? And  how  do  we  get  all  the  raw  materials  that  we  need  to  stay  alive and  grow  and  maintain  ourselves? We're  going  to  use  all  of these  lessons  that  we  learned  the  first  few  weeks, and  there  were  a  lot  of  them. We're  going  to  start  applying  them  more  into some  of  these  questions  that  hopefully have  a  little  bit  more  intrinsic. What's  the  word  I'm  looking  for  here? Intrinsic  appeal.  I  like  all  the  molecular  stuff. I  did  a  Phd  and  all  the  molecular  stuff. It's,  I  find  it  fun, but  talking  about  metabolism  is, I  think,  a  little  bit  more  intrinsically interesting  for  most  people. We're  going  to  be  doing  that  for the  next  couple  of  weeks  today,  though. I  want  to  set  transition  into  that  a  little bit  and  give  some  context  to  where  that  metabolism  is  happening, why  we  might  need  it,  and  to  start  talking  about  the  cell, this  unit  of  life  that  we've  been  trying  to  build. And  I  want  to  motivate  some  of  that. You  guys  had  a  reading  reading  ten that  give  you  guys  all  sorts  of  information. That  reading  is  largely  by  the  way,  like  contextual,  right? There's  a  lot  of  stuff  about  the  diversity of  living  systems  Really, it's  just  setting  the  stage  for  some  of  the  discussions. As  we  go  through  the  rest  of  the  course, I'll  ask  why  don't  bacteria  typically  get  big? This  is  a  design  challenge,  big  problem. You  go  out  in  the  environment  and  you  pick  up  some  cells. You  can  classify  them  into  bacteria  or  archaea,  we  could  add. And  eukaryotic  cells. And  when  we  look  at  bacteria, we  find  almost  always  that  they  don't  get  really  big, or  at  least  big  compared  to  the  eukaryotic  counterparts. So  why  don't  they  get  big? What  kind  of  problems  are  keeping  them  from  getting  big? Yeah,  You  need  more  energy  to  stay  big,  right? The  bigger  you  get,  the  bigger  the  cytosol, the  more  energy  you  need  to  like  feed  that. Yeah.  Yeah,  Yeah. So  in  order  to  get  more  energy, you  got  to  somehow  consume  more  from  the  environment,  right? Or  managed  to  get  more  of  it  in? Yeah,  smaller  surface  area. Volume.  More  efficient  to  be  smaller because  the  surface  area  to  volume is  smaller  when  you're  a  small  cell. Right.  And  that's  related  to  this  other  idea. Yeah,  that's  really  interesting. So  the  idea  is  that  if  you  get  bigger  in  the  environment, it's  easier  to  be  seen  and  so  you're  more likely  to  get  eaten  by  something  else. What  else?  Yeah.  Oh,  there's something  physically  about  the  actual  materials that  can't  maintain  a  larger  shape. That's  actually  quite  good  too. Yeah.  Yeah.  You  have  to  invest  more  energy  in  reproducing. Yeah.  If  you're  a  big  and  you  want  to  make  a  copy  of  yourself, it  takes  more  energy  to  make  a  copy of  a  big  self  than  it  does  a  small  self. Yeah,  these  are  all  fantastic  challenges  that  need  to  be  overcome. I've  summarized  one  of  these  as  a  sub  problem  that  these  cells, if  they  want  to  get  bigger, they  have  to  deal  with  what  I  said, disproportional  growth  and  energy  transport  demands. This  is  along  those  lines. If  you  get  bigger,  you  need  more  energy. If  you  are  bigger, the  surface  area,  we'll  take  a  look  at  in  a  second. The  volume  increases  disproportionately  to  your  surface  area. You've  got  to  get  more  stuff  in  across  a  smaller  boundary. That's  what  this  sub  problem  is  about, to  look  at  that  idea  more  carefully. Here's  a,  if  we'd  look  at  the  top  left  where  it  says  radius, we  have  a  cell  that's  roughly  spherical, roughly,  We  will  invoke  the  spherical  cow  here. Bring  our  physicist  head  on  and  say, let's  assume  that  every  cell  is  circular,  or  a  spherical. Here's  a  spherical  cell. There's  a  cell  with  a  radius  of  one, with  a  radius  that's  a  little  bit  bigger,  two  x. And  a  cell  with  a  radius  of  three  x. If  we  calculate  the  surface  area  of  that  sphere, we  see  that  the  surface  area, since  it's  a  two  dimensional  plane, goes  as  the  square  of  the  radius. We  have  a  one  surface  area  here, four  x  and  nine  x  surface  areas  for the  12.3  sized  radius,  respectively. Then  if  we  calculate  the  volume  down  below,  what  do  we  see? We  see  the  volume  for  these  respective  radii starts  out  as  1x8x  27  x. We  see  that  the  volume, the  space  inside  the  cell  is  getting bigger  then  the  surface  area  on  the  outside. As  the  cell  grows,  it  gets  disproportionately  large. The  volume  goes,  since  it's  a  three  dimensional  volume, it  goes  as  the  cube  of  the  radius. All  right,  so  what  does  that  mean? You  guys  touched  on  this  already, Let's  imagine  that  all  the  volume  inside this  sphere  is  where  the  business  of  the  cell  is  happening. Where  energy  is  required  to maintain  where  all  sorts of  molecular  transformations  are  going  on. That  means  you've  got  to  get  stuff  into  there  across  the  membrane. We  talked  about  that  last  last  week. This  membrane  acts  as a  gate  keeper  if  you  want  for  stuff  getting  in  to  the  big  volume. And  if  you're  talking  about  waste  that  might  be generated  if  the  inside  is  growing  faster  than  the  surface  area, at  some  point  it's  going  to  be  hard  to  get enough  stuff  in  to  feed  the  growing  inside. If  you're  growing  this  cell  bigger  and  bigger? Yeah.  All  right. That's  this  idea  that  was  brought  up  of  the  surface  area  less, not  as  quickly  as  the  volume  the  surface  area  to  volume  ratio  is. Is  shrinking  as  the  cell  gets  bigger. All  right,  how  do  we  solve  this  problem? Nature  or  an  intrepid  engineer  that  wants  to  make  a  bigger  cell. How  do  we  solve  this  issue  of  the  surface  area getting  the  volume  getting big  and  the  surface  area  not  keeping  up  with  that. Can  we  identify  or  state  what some  successful  criteria  might be  for  any  solution  to  that  problem? What  would  success  look  like as  we're  tinkering  around  with  the  cell? Yeah.  Yeah.  So  you  could  change  the  shape  of  the  cell, but  how  do  you  know  that  it  worked? I'm  asking  what  is  the  criteria  for  success? How  you  do  it  is  change  the  shape  of  the  cell,  right? But  what  would  mark  success  in  your  tinkering? It's  almost  an  obvious  answer,  right? Yeah,  the  cell  doesn't  die,  right? That  might  be  a  great  criterion  for  success. Now,  you  might  also  say, well,  the  cell  lives  in  a  particular  environment. If  you  knew  a  little  bit  more  in  this  environment, to  be  successful,  it  needs  to  replicate every  so  many  days  or  so  many  hours  or  something  like  that. All  right?  So  that  it  doesn't  get, it  grows  faster  than  it  gets  en, those  might  be  like  criteria  for  success  too  that  you  can  assign. In  whatever  design  you're  thinking of  something  you  can  look  back  on  and  say,  why  change  things? Does  the  cell  live  or  does  it  multiply  fast  enough? So  on  and  so  forth. Now  we  asked  identify and  imagine  possible  solutions  we  can  do  that. One  of  you  guys  already  did  said  change  the  shape  of  the  cell. How  might  we  change  the  shape  of the  cell  in  a  way  that's  productive  here? Let's  see  if  Yeah, yeah,  the  main  issue  is  you  want  to  increase the  surface  area  without  increasing  the  volume. That's  excellent.  So  what  are  ways  that  you  can  do  that? Well,  we'll  take  a  look  at  it. Just  for  the  sake  of  completion  of  going  through  this  exercise. Imagine  solutions,  or  we  can  go  out and  nature  and  look  at  certain  solutions. And  then  we  can  evaluate these  solutions  against  does  the  cell  live, does  it  replicate  fast  enough? So  on  and  so  forth.  Are  they good  solutions  is  basically  what  we're  asking  here. Then  once  you've  evaluated  whether  they're good  or  not,  you  can  choose  one. Mostly  I  want  you  guys  to  focus  on  this  quarter, but  for  the  moment,  number  five  is  usually  like, let's  see  what  natural  selection  came  up  with. Here's  one  picture  of how  natural  selection  has  come  up  with  a  solution  to  this  issue. He's  a  cross  section  of  a  cell, of  a  microbial  cell. This  particular  cell. Imagine  that  it's  like  a  rectangular  loaf  of  bread. Picture  the  pre  sliced sandwich  bread  that  you  can  buy  in  the  store. The  little  rectangular  loaves. Instead  of  slicing  them  into  little  squares, slice  it  long  way  so  that  you  get  big  rectangles. You  slice  your  loaf,  then  you  take  one  of those  slices  and  you  look  and  see  what  you  see  through  that  slice. Right?  They'll  be  little  holes  and  stuff  from little  gas  bubbles  in  the  bread  and  so  on  and  so  forth. And  that's  what  we're  looking  at  here. The  researchers  that  made this  picture  sliced  the  bacterium  lengthwise. We're  looking  at  just  one  slice  through  that  bacterium, that  bacterial  loaf  of  bread  if  you  want, we're  seeing  little  bubbles  and sometimes  these  things  connect  to  something  that's  like  out  here. But  since  we're  only  looking  at  a  thin  slice, we  see  the  shadow  of  it. But  every  now  and  then,  you  slice  this  thing  just  right, you  can  see  where  some  of  these  little  bubbles  are. There's  two  arrows  pointing  to  features  here. One  on  the  top  is  basically  just  saying  here's  a  membrane  region. Then  the  one  on  the  bottom  is  showing  a  do  it  here. It's  on  the  recording,  a  nice  little  blip  of  membrane, this  dark  line  here  that  makes  a  little  pocket, it  makes  a  little  invagination  into  the  interior  of  the  cell. All  these  other  things  are  the  same  type  of  deal except  we're  just  because  of  how  we  slice  the  cell, we're  not  able  to  see  where  it  goes  in. We're  just  looking  at  the  whole,  All  right? But  you  can  see  that  there  is  a  lot  of  these  little  blips. Here's  one  that  you  can  see  if  you  trace  around. This  cell  has  done  this  trick of  increasing  the  surface  area  by  taking  up  some  of  the  volume. Packing  membrane  into  it,  into  these, these  little  semi  spherical  structures.  Let's  zoom  in  of  the. Here's  another  example. This  is  another  bacterium. We've  sliced  it  again  lengthwise  like  the  loaf  of  bread. Right?  And  we're  just  looking  at  a  thin  section. We  can  trace  the,  the  PM  here  means  plasma  membrane. We  can  trace  the  plasma  membrane. If  we  zoomed  in  a  little  bit  more, what  we  would  find  is  that plasma  membrane  connects  to  this  thing  that  I've  circled  in  red. I  can't  quite  trace  it,  but we'll  imagine  that  it  comes  through  here. These  are,  LS  stands  for  lamellar  sheets. These  are  more  plasma  membrane  that's  been  added,  folded, and  stuffed  into  the  interior  of  the  cell. Imagine  if  you  took  that  and  unfolded  it, you'd  get  a  lot  of  extra  membrane  surface  area  that's  been all  compacted  and  stuffed  together  into  these  little  sheets. Nature  has  taken  this  idea  you  guys  want. You  guys  came  up  over  there  of increasing  the  surface  area  without  increasing  the  volume by  stuffing  membrane  and  folding  membrane  into  the  volume  itself. We're  doing  to  take  up  some  of  the  inside  by  stuffing  membrane  in there  and  having  more  diffusible  surface  for  energy  recruitment, energy  generation,  waste  exchange, food  recruitment,  so  on  and  so  forth. Okay.  Everybody  okay  with  that? This  is  one  of  nature's  solutions  to the  problem  of  trying  to  get  bigger. These  are  actually  quite  large  bacterial  cells  is  to  fold membranes  into  the  complicated  structures that  allow  more  surface  area  without  increasing  the  volume. Okay.  One  of  the  things  that  didn't  come  up  that  I think  most  of  the  thoughts you  guys  had  had  to  do  with  this  energy  and  the  exchange  of  stuff. And  like  the  volume  was  getting  bigger,  you  needed  more  energy. But  when  you  get  bigger,  another  problem you  get  is  that  you've  got  to  move  things  around  the  cell. When  you're  really  small, stuff  can  go  through  the  membrane, whether  it's  coming  by diffusion  or  by  some  active  transport  or  whatever. Then  it  needs  to  meet  up  with  other  things  in  the  cell. If  it's  food,  it  needs  to  get  processed. The  bigger  you  make  your  volume, the  more  wandering  these  molecules  have  to  do  to  actually  run into  one  another  and  do  something useful  just  getting  stuff  around  the  cell. The  molecules  that  you  bring  in  to  meet  when  they're  supposed  to, where  they're  supposed  to  meet  becomes  harder  and  harder. The  bigger  you  make  the  cell, all  right,  I  won't  do  this. You  guys,  you  can  think  about  this  as  well. But  you  can  think  about,  okay, I've  got  this  problem,  how  do  I  solve  this  problem? One  way  that  nature  has  gone  about  solving this  problem  is  to  make  little  compartments. Why  is  it  useful  to  make  little  compartments? I  got  a  big  cell,  I  got  problems  getting  stuff  around. I'm  going  to  make  little  compartments. All  right.  Why  are  little  compartments  good. What  are  the  trade  offs  that  you  have  when you  evolve  Little  compartments? What  my  little  compartments  allow  you  to  do  to  solve this  trafficking  problem  or  some  other  problem? If  you  want,  I  see  your  hand  but  I'll  come  back  to  you  later. All  right.  Go  for  it.  Yeah. If  you  put  something  in  here, it  keeps  it  from  interacting  with  anything  that's  outside  of  it. Right?  So  that's  a  good  benefit. What  else  is  good  about  little  compartments? Especially  if  we're  thinking  about trafficking  and  making  things  meet. It's  related  to  this  idea. If  I  want  specific  reactions  to happen  and  I  don't  have  these  little  compartments, things  need  to  float  around  this  whole  volume, right,  To  run  into  one  another  and  actually  happen. Even  if  an  enzyme  is  involved, that  enzyme  and  its  substrates  need  to wander  this  whole  volume  before  they  come  and  meet. What  if  I  pack  them  all  in  here? It's  not  that  they  just  don't  talk to  other  stuff,  it's  that  they've, if  I  managed  to  target  those  reactions  to  these  little  vesicles, then  they  have  a  little  teeny  volume  in  which  to  take  place. I  can  make  little  specialized  compartments. Where  specific  reactions  don't have  to  wander  around  the  whole  cell. They  can  happen  in  one  place where  stuff  is  likely  to  run  into  each  other  much more  often  and  have  those  reactions  happen  at  a  reasonable  rate. That's  nice,  but  is  there  a  trade  off, like  if  I'm  building  the  cell  or  if  I'm  evolving  the  cell, I  just  solve  some  problem of  needing  to  get things  together  so  that  they  can  actually  happen. I  stuff  them  in  a  little  vesicle so  that  they  run  into  each  other  a  lot. Did  that  cost  me  anything?  Was  there  a  trade  off? Yeah.  Oh,  I  got  to  get  them  in. Right.  And  I  got  to  get  specific  things  into  the  actual  vesicle. That's  excellent. Yeah,  yeah. Actually  I  heard  two  things  right. One  is  you  actually  have  to  make  the  vesicles, that's  going  to  cost  you  something,  right? Whether  it's  lipid  and,  or  the  energy  to  assemble  them. And  then  it  might  well  be  that  the  vehicles  need  to  be  in a  particular  location  and  so  you  need to  find  some  way  of  putting them  where  they're  supposed  to  be  in  the  cell. That's  going  to  be  a  cost  that  you  have  to  bear  to  right  then. The  first  idea  that  was  brought  up is  that  something  comes  into  the  cell,  crosses  the  membrane. If  we  need  to  get  specific  reactants  in  this  vehicle, we  need  to  actually  develop some  sorting  system  and  transport  system to  get  things  in  there  specifically.  Right. All  right.  I  don't  know  if  I'm  getting  there  right. We  can  play  this  game  of  like  we've  got  a  big  problem  to  solve. How  do  we  deal  with  it?  Let's  come  up  with  some  solutions. Let's  see  what  nature  did. Nature  decided  to  make  little  compartments. We  can  already  infer  what the  next  lesson  is  going  to  be  in  the  class by  thinking  about  what  are  the  issues  that  come  up when  you  make  these  little  compartments.  I  made  them.  Great. What  did  it  cost  me  to  make  them? How  do  I  actually  use  them? Yeah.  Okay.  That's  the  attitude of  the  approach  of  some  of  this  design  thinking. Nature  has  come  up  as  you  guys  well  know, taking  those  basic  ideas  and  expanded  on  them  like  crazy,  right? If  we  look  at  a  typical  eukaryotic  cell. A  cell  that  has  a  membrane  bound  nucleus. A  typical  cartoon  from  somewhere online  showing  the  extent  to  which  nature  has  packed membranes  into  the  interior  of  the  cell  to  both  increase surface  area  and  to  create specialized  compartments  that  can  have a  reduced  volume  where  specific  reactions  can  take  place. One  of  the  things  I  want  you  guys  to  do  as  you  go  through, I  mentioned  it  last  week  as  well, but  is  to  start making  some  of  your  own  little  sketches  of  what  a  cell  looks  like. You  carry  out  Excel  in  the  bacterial  cell. Add,  make  a  little  bean  shaped  thing  with  some  internal  membrane. Call  it  the  mitochondria. And  then  write  a  little  sentence  about whatever  the  definition  is  that  you  find  online  or  in  the  book. Some  people  like  the  powerhouse  of  the  cell. That's  fine  with  me.  You  can  write nucleus  DNA  storage  compartment,  something  like  that. Right  now  we  just  need  a  very  basic  understanding. We  can  talk  about  gold.  This  is  like a  protein  processing  and  modification  organ. Again,  if  we're  good  at  that  level,  I'm  happy. But  we  can  see  the  nature  has  taken  this, these  ideas  and  run  with  them  quite  dramatically. Not  only  animal  cells  or  some  eukaryotic  single  celled  organisms. Plants  have  done  the  same  thing. Packaged  DNA  inside  a  double  membrane. Then  the  plants  will  have  chloroplasts  and  mitochondria. We'll  talk  about  chloroplasts  in  a  couple  of  weeks. Many  plant  cells  have  a  big  vacuum, where  there's  basically  water  stored. Just  start  getting  a  sense  of  what  these  cells  look  like. You  know,  the  usual  cartoon  drawing  of  stuff. And  then  attach  some  very  basic  function  to  it. Like  in  the  function  is  really what  problem  is  this  thing  solving  for  the  cell,  right? So  think  about  it  that  way. All  right,  so  I want  to  focus  on  one  of  the  things  in  those  drawings  today, and  that  is  the  cytoskeleton. And  then  we'll  get  back  to  other  organelles as  we  go  through  metabolism  as  they  appear. The  cytoskeleton  is  a  series  of  proteins. That  have  a  variety  of  functions. Then  the  key  proteins  that  I  want  you  guys  to  know  about  are  actin here  on  the  left  and  tubulin  on  the  right. There  are  other  fibers  like these  intermediate  filaments  that  are made  out  of  keratin  and  other  proteins. I  guess  I  want  you  to  know  that  they're  there, but  really  I  want  to  focus  on  the  other  two  type  of  filaments. For  the  most  part,  the  protein  structures like  the  name  suggests,  right? It's  a  skeleton.  It  provides  a  frame  or  structure  for  the  cell, helps  maintain  the  cell  shape. But  maybe  more  interestingly  to  me  anyway, is  that  filaments  coupled  with  other  proteins, the  ability  for  the  cell  to  change  shape, provide  ability  for  the  cell  to transport  things  around  that  big  volume. This  idea  of  like  how  do  we  get things  from  one  compartment  to  the  next, or  even  from  outside  the  cell  to  a  specific  compartment. These  proteins  are  involved  in  that, these  proteins  are  involved  in  the  process  of  cell  division. We'll  see  later  in  the  quarter, they're  not  skeletal  structures  as  the  name  might  suggest. If  we  think  about  our  skeleton,  it's  pretty  passive. It  just  sits  there  for  the  most  part  and provides  a  thing  to  hang  everything  else  on. The  cytoskeletal  proteins  in  cells  are  much  more dynamic  and  are  used  in  a  variety  of  different  ways. What  else  do  I  want  you  guys  to  know  about  these  guys? I  want  you  to  know  that  structural  proteins are  make  up  filaments  in  the  cell  that  act, makes  up  filaments  called  microfilaments. That  tubulin, the  protein  tubulin  makes  up  filaments  called  microtubules. We'll  look  at  these  both  in  more  detail  in  a  second. But  if  you're  writing  down  like  what  are associations  that  you  should  memorize? Memorize  that  act  microfilaments. Tubulin  makes  microtubules,  and  that's  a  good  start. All  right,  when  we  look  at  these  in  the  cell, here's  some  cells  growing  on  a  surface,  on  a  flat  surface. This  is  a  fluorescent  image. Fluorescent  light  microscopy. We're  looking  at  multiple  cells. Each  one  of  these  blue  dots  is  a  nucleus. The  scientists  here  that  made  this  picture  stained  the  DNA  blue, which  is  cool,  actually  it's  false  color. But  they  made  DNA  light  up  in  this  domain  colored  blue. They  painted  the  microtubules. The  microtubules,  maybe  I  need  to  change  battery. They  painted  those  green.  Let's  see, where's  the  drawer  have  batteries. They  painted  the  actin  microfilaments  red. Well,  I  changed  the  battery. Take  a  second  and  look  and  see  if  you  see  any  patterns about  how  the  actin  and  the  tubulin  are  spread. All  right.  I  don't  see  if  that's  any  better. Any  patterns  about  how  the  tubulin  and  actin  might  be  behaving? Yeah,  so  you're  noticing  the  tubulin and  green  seems  to  be  crowded  around  the  nucleus  and the  act  seems  to  be  most  dense  farther  out.  Right? Now,  that's  exactly  what  I was  hoping  you  guys  would  notice,  right? That  distribution  of  these  fibers  is  not  uniform,  right? It  suggests  that  they  each  have  their  own  function. Now  there's  green  almost  everywhere, and  there's  red  almost  everywhere. They're  reaching  almost  everywhere  in  the  cell. But  these  guys  here  seem  crowded  around  the  center. If  the  center  is  defined  by the  nucleus  spreading  out  towards  the  edges, the  microfilaments  tend  to  be, there's  a  nice  little  crowded  red  line around  the  edges  of  the  cell. That  tells  us  already that  they  probably  have  slightly  different  roles, different  functions  in  the  cell  now  microtubules. We  notice  we're  starting  around the  nucleus  and  spreading  out  towards  the  edge. M  means  plasma  membrane  here. In  fact,  I,  I  don't  know  if it's  because  it's  hard  to  always  say  what  nature  intended,  right? But  one  of  their  roles is  to  act  as  connecting  points  between  different  organelles. The  nucleus,  the  Golgi  here, and  the  plasma  membrane  are  all  anchored  on these  filaments  that  are made  of  tubulin  that  radiate  out  from  the  center, out  towards  the  edge  of  the  cell. That  solves  that  problem  that  came  up  of  trying  to  figure  out  how do  we  place  these  organelles  in  the  right  spot  in  the  cell. We  get  them  to  a  spot, we  can  fix  them  on  this  network, cytoskeletal  network  that's  in  the  cell then  I  don't  know  if  they  stay  put  per  se, but  they're  semi  anchored  in  that  spot. Certainly  relative  to  the  nucleus  and  the  plasma  membrane. What  else  do  these  little  ropes  or  cables  that  are  connecting these  organelles  allow  us  to  do  or  allow  the  cell  to  do  well. They  allow  the  cell  to  have  little  paths  or  again, cables  along  which  stuff  can  get  transported  from  the  nucleus  to, in  this  case  the  Golgi  and  the  Golgi  out  plasma  membrane. They  provide  roads  if  you  want  to move  stuff  between  different  parts of  the  cell  from  one  organal  to  the  next. Now  if  we  zoom  in  to  some  of  these  structures, we'll  talk  about  actins  role  in  a  little  bit  as  well. We  see  that  each  of these  fibers  is  made  up  of  individual  protein  monomers. These  protein  monomers  bind a  nucleotide  either  in  the  form  of  ATP  or  ADP, or  in  the  case  of  tubulin,  GDP,  GTP. We'll  talk  more  about  those  molecules in  the  next  few  weeks  as  well. I  want  you  to  recognize  also  that  this  molecule, while  it's  globe  shaped, also  isn't  completely  symmetric,  right? It's  got  an  end  here  that  looks  different  from  the  bottom. These  little  molecules,  each  one  of these  little  orange  spheres  represents  one  of  these  proteins. They  assemble  into  these  fibers through  functional  group  interactions,  right? Another  one  of  these  molecule  comes and  nestles  up  to  the  bottom  here. Because  this  thing  is  not  symmetric, neither  of  the  fibers,  each one  of  these  fibers  has  therefore what  we  call  a  plus  and  a  minus  end. The  minus  end  is  the  end  where  monomers  fall  off. The  plus  end  is  the  end  where  monomers  add  to  a  fiber. We  can  grow  these  fibers  by  adding new  actin  molecules  on  this  end. And  they  can  shrink  by  removing  molecules  of  actin  from  this  end. The  role  of  ATP  and  ADP  will  cover  some  other  time. Tubulin  fibers,  they  have  a  little, slightly  different  shape,  right? They're  more  tube  like,  here's  a  dimer  of  tubulin. These  dimers  also  can  add  on  a  plus  end  and  come  off  a  minus  end. These  structures  are  made  up  of  monomers. They're  not  symmetric  and  they're  dynamic. They  can  grow  and  shrink  by  adding  new  monomers to  end  and  losing  them  from  the  minus  end. All  right,  Everybody  good  with  that  so  far? Questions?  All  right. We  have  these  networks  of  fibers  that  we  can  see  in  this  picture. The  fibers  are  made  of  two  different  proteins. We've  got  tubulin  fibers  and  actin  fibers. They're  not  just  uniformly  spread. One  of  them  seems  to  come  out  and  radiate out  from  the  center  of  the  cell. The  other  one  seems  to  be  more  concentrated  at  the  edges. Those  still  has  some  role  in  the  middle. Fibers  are  made  out  of monomers  of  proteins  that  are  not  symmetric. The  stack  up  on  one  end  and  come  off  on  the  other. We  can  grow  a  new  fiber  out  this  way. By  adding  monomers  to  the  plus  end, we  can  shrink  it  by  removing  them  from  the  minus  end. All  right.  We  said  that  some  of  these  fibers, the  microtubules  for  instance, had  the  role  of  acting  as not  only  anchors  on  which  you  could  place organelles  and  organize  things  in  the  cell, but  they  could  also  act  as little  highways  along  which cargo  could  move  from  one  place  to  the  next. That  to  me  anyway,  is  the  more  fun  thing. There  are  these  molecules  called  molecular  motors. In  this  case,  we  have  one  that's called  Kinesin  and  that's  depicted here  as  a  purple  twisted  thing. This  little  molecular  motors  role  is  to  use chemical  energy  to  transport  cargo  from  one  organelle  to  another. Inside  these  little  loaded  vehicles, along  these  fibers,  they  literally  walk  along  these  fibers. These  little  molecular  motors  are  proteins  as  well. You  have  proteins  interacting  with  protein  motors, interacting  with  protein  fibers,  again, through  functional  group  interactions  that  we've  been  studying. Proteins  interacting  with  other  proteins inside  this  lipid  vesicle  that's  holding something  that  needs  to  move  around the  cell  and  they're  moving  along  these  fibers. In  this  particular  picture, what's  nice  is  it's  showing  that this  motor  is  moving  in  a  particular  direction. It's  going  from  the  minus  end  to  the  plus  end. There's  this  molecule  that transports  cargo  from  one  in  a  directional  way, from  one  side  of  the  cell  to  the  next. Here's  a  little  simulation  of  what  that  might  look  like. This  thing  is  a  protein.  Here  comes  ATP. Got  hydrolyzed  to  ADP. You  guys  remember  that  from  last  time? That  was  an  exergonic  reaction. As  that  cycle  of  ATP  hydrolysis  continues, that  enables  the  fueling  of  this  protein  to  literally walk  along  a  fiber  of  other  protein  here,  microtubule. What's  not  depicted  is  the  cargo  on the  top  to  carry  things  from  one  end  of  the  cell  to  the  next. I  want  to  look  at  that  one  more  time  because  I  think  it's  fun. This  motor  head  lands  on  the  microtubule, recruits  the  second  one  to  land  on  the  microtubule  as  well. When  our  ATP  comes  into  one  head, that  causes  a  structural  change  in  the  protein  that  swings around  the  other  motor  ADP  is  released. New  ATP  comes  in  that  allows  What  kind  of  protein  is  this, by  the  way  we  have  a  name  for? Is  this  an  enzyme?  Is  the  transport, it's  a  transport  protein. It's  not  a  transmembrane  transporter, but  it  is  a  transport  protein. Is  it  an  enzyme?  What  reaction  is  it  catalyzing? It's  catalyzing  the  directional  movement  of  the  molecular  motor, right  of  itself  along  a  fiber. Is  this  a  coupled  reaction? Like  remember  we  had  before  the  exam, we  talked  about  some  reactions  had  negative  free  energy  and they  could  be  used  to  pay  for  things  that  needed  energy. Those  were  coupled  reactions. Is  this  the  coupled  reaction? Yeah.  What's  the  endergonic  part  of  this? The  part  that  needs  energy? A  little  loud.  There  was  some  murmur  around  here. Yeah,  the  binding. The  binding  or  unbinding,  That's  part  of  it. Let's  think  even  more  simply  though, what  is  the  thing  that  needs  energy  here? Taking  the  step  taking,  right? You're  carrying  some  cargo. You  take  some  work  to  take  that  step, to  take  the  next  step,  et  cetera,  along  that  rail. What  is  the  exergonic  reaction, the  thing  that  gives  it  the  energy in  this  case  to  take  those  steps. It  was  the  same  one  we  talked  about  with the  calcium  ATPase  last  time. The  ATP  hydrolysis,  right here  we  have  that  same  chemical  reaction  that  we  used  last time  when  we  talked  on  Wednesday  to  transport calcium  across  against  this  concentration  gradient. We  said  going  against your  gradient  is  endergonic.  It  takes  energy. We  need  to  find  some  energy  for  that. We  use  this  molecule  that  again, we'll  talk  about  in  much  more  detail over  the  next  couple  of  weeks. But  we  use  this  molecule  called  ATP, that  when  hydrolyzed  would  give  us  some  energy. The  enzyme  would  couple  those  two  reactions, and  overall,  that  would  be  a  negative  delta  g, and  we  could  have  that  reaction  go. This  is  the  same  deal.  Here  we've  got a  machine  protein  machine  and enzyme  whose  role  it  is  to  transport  stuff  across. Basically  a  low  cable  that  requires  some  energy. The  energy  is  coming  from,  again, the  same  source,  the  hydrolysis  of  ATP. Great.  All  right,  question  for  home. More  stuff  for  home  review.  For  home. Okay,  in  the  last  couple  minutes. Good  timing  here  I  want  to  just  introduce this  idea  that  we're  going  to  use  in  our  discussion  of  metabolism. We've  already  introduced  this  idea  of  ATP, which  has  to  do  with  Discover  Phosphate. Group  transfer  is  what  we're  going  to  call  it. There's  another  really  important  reaction  when  we  talk  about metabolism  that  involves  electron  transfer. And  I  want  to  give  you  a  sense  of  that  as  we  get  ready  to. There's  a  little  sound  thing, There's  some  bigs  mess  around  here. Okay,  let's  see  if  you  can  hear  anything. All  right.  So  we're  looking  at  a  little  movie. This  potassium  permanganate. That's  what  this  salt  is  here. And  it's  getting  heated  up  to  melted  down and  make  a  liquid,  then  that's  a  gummy  bear. There's  no  sound  where  the  hell's  a  sound. It's  got  all  of  crackling  and  popping  and  all  that  stuff. I'm  going  to  argue  that  this  reaction  here, it's  a  reaction  between  the  sugar  and  the  gummy  bear. This  carbohydrate  here. The  oxygen  in  this  salt, the  Gb  melted  down  to  make  CO  two, water  and  potassium  chloride. Poor  little  gummy  bear. I  did  this  once  as  a  demo  over  in  silk. Stupid  little  gummy  bear  made  this  huge  cloud  of  smoke. It  actually  smelled  really  good,  like  caramelized  stuff. But  I  was  scared. I  was  going  to  set  off  some  fire  alarm or  something,  so  we  never  did  it  again. But  we  show  a  video  instead. Anyway,  what  do  you  guys  think  of  this  reaction is  a  spontaneous  reaction. Looks  like  it,  right?  You  put  the  gummy  bear in  that  liquid  and  all  of  a  sudden, boom,  that  gummy  bear  turns  into  something  else,  right? Turns  into  CO  two  and  water. There's  a  lot  of  energy  in  that.  I'm  going  to  argue. And  we'll  come  back  next  time  and  start talking  about  the  core  reaction  that's  happening  here. Electrons  are  being  transferred  from  the  sugar  to  oxygen. That  transfer  of  electrons  is  extremely  energetically  favorable. There's  a  lot  of  energy  in  the  sugar, and  it's  being  released  by  transferring electrons  to  the  sugar,  to  oxygen. Sorry,  we'll  come  back  and  talk  about  how  that's  related to  what  happens  when  we  eat sugar  and  how  we  get  energy  off  the  sugar  for  ourselves.\n",

      "0  Which is weird, is that? Any better? Is this any better? Yeah, that's better. Okay. So today we are going to continue. I want to sort of review what we did last time and then finish up this area so we can move into memory systems next time. So any questions before we start? I will sort of apologize if things seem a little bit. The problem was that when I taught this last 154B was a required class, not last last, but I used to teach this regularly, and 154B was a required class. So there basically wasn't much of what we've been talking about in here because you had to take 154B. Now, the CS students don't have to take 154B, but they need as much of that information as I can. can shove in here as possible. So I'm still trying to smooth some of that out. We've sort of seen something and then done something. And then people said, I didn't understand that first part. And then we're kind of, so hopefully, hopefully it'll be more clear. All right. So on Wednesday, we were talking about performance. [ 7.86016658e-02 -3.67479399e-02  4.24303301e-02  5.33505827e-02\n",

      "1 And remember, we basically said that you performance, If we want to know how to design a new machine, if we want to know whether I should buy machine A and machine B, we need to have some agreed upon alphabet. We need to be, we need to know what performance means, which we said was throughput and response time. Those are the two types of performance we're talking about. We're going to look at elapsed time as what matters the most. We talked about different possibilities, but elapsed time is what makes the most sense. That's what you really want to know. How long does it take to do this thing? So this is the focus we'll have. How do we measure the elapsed time? What do we say we did? Intuitively, what do you want to do if you want to measure the elapsed time on two different machines? You want to run a program of some sort. I'm going to measure the elapsed time. That implies something is running. So I run something on machine A and run something on machine B and see which one had the shortest elapsed time.

      "2 and we say running something, we need to run something that's representative of what I'm going to do on the machine. Ideally, I would just run that program, that one program that I run all the time on the two. Of course, that doesn't exist. So we needed to come up with a set of programs that I could run on the two machines so that I could get an idea of which, which one of them is going to work better for me. We talked about the different benchmarks that were used in the past, the toys and the synthetics, and we talked about the importance, remember that this needs to be representative of what I'm doing. There's a saying that I didn't touch on Wednesday, but essentially for better or worse, benchmarks shape a field because sales drives everything. Companies have to be able to sell their machines. You sell your machine by having a lower elapsed time than your competitors do. Therefore, entire machines have been designed just to run certain benchmarks faster, which if the benchmark is really well done, maybe that makes sense. But the biggest problem we have, right?

      "3 That is a problem for we architects is that you're essentially designing the machine of tomorrow based on behavioral patterns of yesterday. I'm going to take these benchmarks, which are things that I've been doing on the machine and then design my hardware to do those things really fast, even though I may be doing brand new things right now. You think about the move to AI, the move to streaming, the move to the internet. This is just a hard problem. It doesn't really have a solution. You have to sort of be building machines to run the current stuff quickly while also looking at the market and trying to figure out what's likely to happen next. And that's why often, I mean, 1990 when the Internet arrived, that was just a black swan. Just nobody saw that coming. Suddenly everything was different. And it took a while to recuperate from that. AI is similar. People didn't expect it to be quite as impactful, although it wasn't as much out of left field. It just came on faster than people expected streaming. We've always been able to do streaming, but streaming was limited by the networks and by a bunch of stuff that have now gotten faster.

This is now paraflops. Or maybe fump the flops. I don't remember which. Really, really, really big number. But this is still kind of okay. But what we really want is this, this, how long did it take concept? Even if we're reporting how long it took, we run them into issues because it depends upon the frequency that you execute certain.

      "5 things as we sort of referred to last time if I have two programs and I run them each equally that's going to give me a different elapsed time than if I run one of them 95% of the time and the other one rarely so you even got to keep that in mind we wound up what most things are using now are ratios the special ratio for example ratios are I run the benchmark on your new machine I run the benchmark on a reference machine and then I tell you how much faster it was not great we talked about the problem is how do you keep that reference machine up to date but that seems to be the least bad option now what you really want to do is just give all kinds of information and in fact to their credit the spec people if you're going to publish spec benchmark results for your machine you have to or they will sue you you have to give the results for unoptimized code give the results for 03 code and i don't know if if you had enough compiling classes yet. Basically, there's 0-0-1, 02, and 03. Each of those are more aggressive compiler optimizations with the caveat that they will give you correct behavior. There is 04 and 05.

      "6 You could try compiling something with minus 04. It'll work. What that one does is, well, we're going to try some optimizations that should work. If you have really pathological program, then it'll crash. or it'll give wrong answers. But who does that? So there's 0-4s and 05s and 06s. But you need to publish the 0000-0-0-0-0-3, maximum guaranteed correct ones. And then you can publish one that you don't have to tell anybody how you did it. You've got some super duper gizmo inside your machine that the normal, that's what happens a lot of times, is I'll add some piece of hardware that will really speed things up. But normal compilers don't know about it. So you get to publish your, I built a compiler just for my new machine and it can exploit all this new hardware and look how fast it goes, which is fine. As long as you put those other numbers on there, right? The problem was that you should just be, you just get to say that really fast one and then it was unfair.

      "7 So they do that pretty well. Okay, so any question about that so far? Then we talked about making it faster. Make it faster. Right, and we talked about how do I do that. I make the clock faster. I get more done each. each clock or I use fewer blocks okay and these are all really important this one basically is technology helps us with this one right every 18 months everything is half as big so potentially my clock can just go faster this is sort of the technology term which again is not exclusively technology because we've also talked about I can rearrange some of the hardware to make the clock faster. I can use a carry look ahead adder instead of a ripple carry adder and I'll potentially be able to make the clock faster. So it's not exclusively, but primarily, if I do nothing else at all, 18 months from now, it'll be faster because everything's shrunk. This one, the more done each clock, this is a function of the organization, primarily, depending upon if I'm doing a single cycle, multi-cycle, what my instruction set looks like, et cetera. Think about that. [ 1.27001256e-02 -5.84445596e-02  9.88535490e-03 -3.25743556e-02\n",

      "8 If I have a single cycle machine, I can't get as much done. I'm very limited by what I can get done in a single cycle. And then this one is the compiler. If I can have an optimizing compiler, which throws out a bunch of unnecessary code, then I won't need as many clocks to get the thing done. So we wound up saying that my CPU time is going to be equal to instructions for program times the cycles or instruction for instruction times the time for cycle. This is the time for cycle. This is a the three term equation. How many instructions are there? That's sort of this one. Optimizing compiler. We can cut down on the number of this one. How many cycles do I need per instruction? That goes back to our one bus, two bus, three bus. Does it take three cycles, five cycles, nine cycles, one cycle? And then this one is how long is each cycle?

      "9 So if I know this term, this equation is fantastic because it now, allows you to really reason about potential new architectures you have a new architecture as we said last time if I want to go to one cycle per instruction and that makes my instructions for program go way up I need to know if that's a linear relationship and if the number has gone up more than this then I need to so you can just figure out what your impact on the CPU time is likely to be so really really important equation so any any questions about that yes this will be on the test okay you should know this one this one is not hard this one is one of those if you understand what's going on it's common sense so yes I might ask what is the CPU time equation just because this one is not rocket science I how many instructions are on the program, et cetera. You can almost derive it backwards. Remember, we said this one was actually cycles per instructions, I mean, instructions per program. This was cycles per pro, yeah, anyway. Yeah, good to know. This is a really good one to know. Okay, what we didn't, this is where we ended last time. [-2.64944532e-03  1.85409021e-02  5.78621477e-02 -5.45609333e-02\n",

      "10 There's another thing that's really important to understand when you're trying to figure out how to design a machine, how to make it faster, something called Omdahl's Law, which again, like Moore's Law, it's not a law at all, it's just kind of an observation, but Amdahl's Law says that performance gained by using performance gained by using faster mode is limited by amount of time that mode. Okay, there are equations related with this. Every year when I give this on assessment three, people just write the equations and they don't make any sense because using an equation blindly does not convey any understanding at all. So I always say don't use the equation and then people use it anyway and then they don't like what they get. What are we talking about here? So how does this relate to what we've been talking about? Suppose you have floating point, you run your benchmarks and you find out that floating point uses up 50% of the execution time. And the floating point square root is actually 20% of the execution time. We know these two things. which one should we do? Should I do floating point twice as fast?

      "11 Make floating point twice. Or make floating point square root 10 times fast? So with Amdahl's law and understanding what we're doing, we can be presented with something like this. Which one of these should I have my engineers work on? Which one of these do you think would make the most sense right now? So the best way to approach this is say I have a hundred a program execution time is 100 right and so 50 of that is floating point and 20 of that is the floating point square root so if i make this one twice as fast what would the overall execution time become 75 time units if I make this one infinitely fast what would be the limit to the time it would take if this one took zero time what would this go to 80 so which one of these should you do it's not going it's actually going from 20% to 2 right so this is actually But in the limits, if it went infinitely fast, I would still need at least 80 time units. So you can look at this and say, now, which one of these should you have your engineers work on? Yeah, this one is going to give you fewer cycles used, right? This is going to take less time than this one does. [-6.76142201e-02 -2.62193177e-02 -1.70045402e-02 -3.03817424e-03\n",

      "12 So that's essentially what Omdahl's law is it allows you to Wow, 10x faster seems like a really cool idea But it's not used enough For it to actually be an overall win When I first came here We were in a drought Surprise, surprise, California having a drought Who'd have thought it? And the drought was really bad And so they were talking about having all of the cities Reduce their water consumption by like 20%. The problem was that agriculture used 75% of the water. So you're talking about a 20% reduction of a 25% term. That doesn't make any sense. Omdahl's law says, don't do that. Find a way to have the agriculture, you know, go after the big term. So Almondal's law is definitely rooted in common sense. You just, this was actually what was kind of interesting was this comes up a huge amount in parallel processing. And he actually didn't believe in parallel processing. So he put forth this to show that parallel processing was a bad idea. He was a big believer in uniprocessing.

      "13 This parallel processing is all nonsense because you basically, you're limited by the amount of time you can't do parallelism right I can parallelize 20% of the code well that means that the 80% term still sits there and you're better off to attract that to attach that to attack the 80% term and make it go to 40 then you are to attack that 20% term and make it go to zero sort of what we have right there so I'mdahl didn't believe in parallel processing Sort of came up with this. It's true. It really, though, boils down to how much are these, right? If I can parallelize 80% of the program, well, then maybe I should look at parallelism. So you just have to know what's going on and then reason your way through this. So any questions about that? We didn't talk about Almdahls last time. An important point. Okay, so now you are in a position to make informed decisions going forward. You want to buy a new computer, a new phone, a new whatever.

      "14 device and now realize in the case of phones, nobody looked at that, they just buy an iPhone because they're all sheep. See, I have an Android, so I get to say that. Anyway, benchmarks, some people do care about benchmarks. Now you are in a position to understand what a benchmark is. Are the benchmark results that they're reporting appropriate? I mean, not always. There are frequently times when bad websites will publish benchmark results that are just nonsense. They're running a floating point benchmark on a phone. Phones don't run floating point, right? That's not what they do. That's ridiculous. How did they report the results? You see them telling you the MIPS numbers, you know, to go find a different store to work at, because that's ridiculous. You, the other thing that they've really done, and this was disappointed me because the last quarter, this was my big build to the big reveal, and then everybody missed it on the next assessment, which meant it didn't land quite as well as I'd hoped. So when we talk about performance, we're kind of naturally thinking response time, right? [ 3.11540086e-02 -5.38352057e-02  3.46285589e-02  6.11632578e-02\n",

      "16 You have to come up with a machine that's faster, and I can't make this one any faster, and what do you do? Well, I guess you're all fired. I have to get somebody else. What would you do? You already know the answer to this, so just say it. I have a working machine. I have a working design. I need twice as, I'm going to have twice as many transistors soon, they'll fit in the same space. What would you do? No. Well, I would just put two of them on there, which is what you just said. I got a design, it works. It takes this much space. Now I can suddenly get twice as many transistors, so I'll just put two cores on the same dye. And now I've, but what you've really done is increase the throughput, not the response time, but they don't tell you that. They say, look, we've got four cores now. And four cores is clearly better than two cores, because four is bigger than two. And they're not telling you that what they're, the reason for is better than two.

      "17 is either for throughput or if it's for response time, you have to have a program that is perfectly parallelizable so we can run on all four cores simultaneously, which there aren't very many of, and then there's eight cores on a die, and then there's 16 cores on a die. And so you've moved into this new realm where they've changed the meaning of throughput, but they haven't exactly lied, because that is one of them. the meanings of throughput. So we just switched from this to this and hope nobody noticed. But it is kind of worse because if you have an eight core die, you've seen, we've talked about the fact that the clock rates have to go down because I've got so many transistors on there generating heat and I can't shrink the voltage anymore, but the clock rates go down. You have an eight core processor. It's got like a one and a half gigahertz clock, 1.8 gigahertz. They were three gigahertz a few years back, probably a few decades in my case, but a while back, your frequencies were much higher.

      "18 So now I've put a whole bunch of cores on the chip, but I've turned the clock way down, so this now is way smaller, but these haven't changed. So what's actually happening to an individual core performance is worse. So my response time for an individual program may very well be worse on an eight-core machine than it is on a two-core machine because of all the heat. So because age is bigger than two, and I've got to sell this thing to you. So look, mine's got eight cores. That's really good. You should buy it. That two is old. You don't want the two, but they're just hoping you don't know that equation. And most people don't. So most people buy the eight core, and then they discover that, okay, so it's not a particularly good thing. There's also, not only does it have to run slower, but now you've got competition for the I.O. bus, because you've got eight different things trying to go through an off-ramp instead of only two things. etc. Yeah. It's bigger. [-4.94297482e-02 -4.03315164e-02 -7.18111638e-03  2.28016563e-02\n",

      "19 Eight's bigger than two. That's good, right? I mean, really there is none. There is, I have to do something to get you to buy my machine and I can't think of anything else and putting twice as many on there, the salespeople can sell it. That's pretty much what it is. Now, when your numbers are fairly small, two cores, four cores might have a benefit because you could imagine the operating system running on one of the cores. Okay, so now you don't have to bring the operations in and out. And so, you know, in some jobs you can get a little bit of parallelism or maybe, you know, you might be doing three or four things on your machine at once. So maybe each of those things has their own core, but you're not doing 32 different things, right? I read that the, that was pretty fine, that the best use of a 32 core machine is to have you your job run in the upper right hand corner until it overheats and then just move the job to the bottom left where it's not as hot and let it run down there.

      "20 So you're really only running one job at a time. You're just moving around on the die to the cool parts because you're just not going to use 32 cores. Now if you're doing scientific, hardcore scientific programming, that's a different ball of wax. They, they, you know, your GPUs are incredibly bad for the environment because they basically just use an enormous amount of electricity, get extremely hot, and in theory, that's okay because you're not using them for everything. You're supposed to be using them for graphics processing, except that now people have gone, oh, look, I can also use these things for everything else. And there was a talk in the ECE department a while back where it's just, it's just destroying the world. If we continue out the rate we are, which, you know, you never do. There was these great graphs that said, I'll save that for later, but anyway, we're using a lot of heat on these graphics processing as GPUs because they just go out of their way to try to cool it so you can run faster.

      "21 Now, for those of you who have heard of turbo boost, Intel has this thing called turbo boost, and what Turbo Boost does is it basically has all these sensors on the chip, and it detects the current temperature. So if you have an eight-core chip and only one thing running, then there's a lot of places for the heat to move away to. So Intel will turn up the clock rate. So you're generating a little more heat, but the heat can dissipate away and that's okay. And then they monitor it. And as soon as it gets too hot, then they cut the CPU speed back down. Right. So if you've got all eight cores running, you can't do that because they're all eight generating. That's why the clock rate that they say 1.8 gigahertz assumes all of the cores are running, and therefore there's nowhere for the heat to go, and therefore that's what that is. But then they recognize, well, most of the time you don't have eight things going, so if you manage to turn off six of them, then we'll let you raise the clock a little bit.

      "22 This is all done. There's turbo boost 1.0, and turbo boost 2.0, and all these various things. It's all about the heat and getting rid of the heat. You'll hear about overclockers. Overclockers, a lot of them are gamers, because what you can do is, remember, we calculated the worst case path. Worst case path is in our case of our ripple carry adder, adding minus one to one, ripples all the way through. How many times you add minus one to one? Well, maybe not very often. So what overclockers do is just turn the clock up past limits and then hope. that nothing goes wrong. And if you're playing a game, that's kind of okay. Because if you drop some pixels or if something gets a little screwed up, whatever. Banks don't ever overclock because a mistake might cost them money. But gamers frequently overclock.

      "23 You can take your CPU and immerse it in liquid coolant and see just how hard you can push this because so much of it is based on getting rid of the heat. So there are people that are playing games. But again, it all comes down to this. This is a really important equation. This thing coupled with the heat that's generated really define a lot of things. So any questions about that? I can say things about Intel now because they're going broke so they won't be able to sue me. Just kidding. Okay. So that's the performance stuff. So now let's look again at this is I want to do enough instruction set talking about so that your lab makes sense so that some of the things that we're doing makes sense. So now that we have this, so we had our one bus machine. I'm not going to draw the whole thing up here. We had this and we had this thing here and we had the one bus and we know all this already. Right? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay, so we had our one bus machine. So our one bus machine is going to take multiple cycles per instruction.

      "24 Time per cycle, it's not really clear. The instructions per program is kind of outside of this area. And then we showed how, boy, if I get rid of some of this stuff and make it be a three bus machine, then my time takes even less. So that was a three bus machine and that would help me because I wouldn't need as many cycles per instruction because I wouldn't have to do that, put it in the X, but that's all I could do because I got one bus and have to wait. So we showed how I could sort of take that five or six steps down to one or down to two or three, but there's still always this problem of the PC's got to be incremented. So it's got to go through the ALU. And the ALU also may have to be used for. [-1.03611037e-01 -1.04011394e-01  1.19795287e-02 -4.45993841e-02\n",

      "25 So when you head for the one single cycle execution, idea you have to start doing things like well I'm going to have the separate incrementer here okay so the PC doesn't have to use the ALU and we mentioned that I'm gonna have to have separate memories instruction and data right because I can't I have to go out and get an instruction and bring it back and then decode it and then figure out what happens and then potentially go to memory and bring that back. So my worst case path has gotten longer. I'm also going to have to start doing things with my instructions set to make this work. So instruction sets, you always have an op code and you have some number of operands. Okay, op code stands for operation code. This is the bit pattern, as you've seen in the lab, as we've seen in the handout. Bits 7654. These are the bits that indicate what the instruction is supposed to do. Operands, these are the things that are being operated on. Do do what to operate. on. So every arithmetic instruction has three operands. Destination is equal to source op source two. So there's always three operands. [-6.62626624e-02 -1.05045184e-01  9.53270867e-02 -6.69830441e-02\n",

      "26 There's somewhere I'm writing the result and then there's two things that are being operated together. Sometimes these are the same thing. Sometimes these are the same thing, but you always have three operands. So when we talk about these different kinds of instruction sets, we have been looking at what's called a one operand instruction set originally, that's the one with the accumulator, because in a one operand instruction set, it's always accumulator equals accumulator plus operand. So I get to specify what's being added, but as we talked about, this is an accumulator-based machine. This is what always happens. Source and the destination are always the same, and they're implicit. In a two-operand machine, then you get to say what this one is, and you get to say what this one is. So you're specifying two of the three. Note they still have three operands. A one operand machine still has three operands. It's just, how many are you specifying in the instruction? So in this one I'm specifying two. [-4.50282879e-02 -1.05532892e-01  5.18722273e-02 -9.82767064e-03\n",

      "27 One of them serves as both the destination and the source and the other one. So this is the 8-bit machine that we posted, right? It basically said one of the registers was the destination and the source, and the other one was one of the sources. So, when I start trying to do things in a single cycle, then I wind up, I can't do the various addressing modes. So I will use a three operand instruction, and it will usually be a fixed size. We haven't really talked about those of you who had learned on the x86, right? If I have our original machine, then I can have more than one byte be an instruction. I can go out to memory, bring back the byte, the PC points at, put it in the IR, decode the IR, and discover that for this thing, I need to go get another byte as part of the instruction. Bring that in. Work with that. I may need to get more operands for... So the x86 has anywhere from one to five bytes for instruction. I think it's that. It may be more than... This is for the 32-bit one, I think. [-6.65178224e-02 -9.04445797e-02  5.04137091e-02 -2.99041383e-02\n",

      "28 This might be clear back for the smaller one. But the point is that you can have some number because remember I have this process, right? I go out to memory, I bring back something, I put it in the IR, I go, oh, I need to follow this state machine. The state machine may say if the bit pattern is a certain thing, that means I need to go get more stuff, and then I'll go back out and I'll get more stuff. And it's just so that one's going to take many more cycles per instruction. you can have sort of an arbitrarily large instruction if you do that that doesn't work if I'm trying to go to the single cycle stuff can't do that I can't go out to memory twice I can go out to memory once for the instruction I can go out to memory once for the data so I can't add register five to memory location 12 can't do that because I have to figure out the address of the memory operation I have to use the ALU to figure that out. So you wind up with these. And you can see a fixed size is really nice. [-5.77860177e-02 -3.81050147e-02  2.66787950e-02  2.01775003e-02\n",

      "29 Now from the hardware designer standpoint, if I only have to look in bits 7 through 11, that's going to be easier to create the combination of logic for than if I have to look at bits 7 through 11 and sometimes bit 4, sometimes bit 9, and sometimes bit 2, all those bits then are going to have to run to your combination of logic block. and then they're going to be so you really want a fixed size and fixed if you can these are really handy right i'm like i said i'm going to have to really cut back on what i can do because i have to do everything in single cycle so i'm going to wind up with something called a load store instruction set meaning I do arithmetic only on registers and I have to do a load or a store to Mem. What that basically says is if I want to get something in memory, I have to explicitly do a load instruction, bringing it in, putting it in one of the registers, then I can use it. So if that's the way I have to use it, I'll probably want a lot of registers as many as I can get, as many as I can fit in the instruction set.

      "30 the I'm going to wind up then with three different formats. I'm going to have an R type, which is going to basically be an op code, and then the register destination, register source one, register source two, and usually that's some leftover stuff because these don't necessarily take as much space. I'm going to have an immediate type or I have op code. I'm going to have the register destination and the register source one and the immediate field. So in a register, my three operands, register type, my three operands are all specified right here in the instruction. These are the addresses of the registers that will be involved in doing whatever this says. And I type, then this is the address of the register. I'm going to write to, this is the address of one of the registers I'm operating on. The other value is coming right out of the instruction, the immediate value. Back in the single, back in the multi-cycle thing, this was handy because I didn't have to go out to memory to get anything. [-9.87746194e-02 -4.53236774e-02  3.57450210e-02  9.75036714e-03\n",

      "31 right it was nice to have the op brand right there in the instruction that saved me time in a single cycle that doesn't really matter so much but there's a lot of times when you want to do a you know if I have an immediate value I don't have to tie up a register and then you're going to have a jump type where you have the op code and then you have this whole thing is an offset So that's the instruction set. These three formats are what the MIPS processor uses in the book. These three are surprisingly not, this is essentially what that 8-bit thing that I put together does. It has these three formats. These fields are way smaller than in the bigger machines, but sort of my opinion is, if you can wrap your head around it it's easier to understand and frequently when you're talking about a 32-bit machine where everything is 8 bytes or 6 4 bytes long 32 bits all of it is just right so we just did a 6 an 8-bit machine with all of these features except it wasn't single cycle but it had basically these features So you can sort of see that this is how this works.

      "32 And now all that happens in the MIPS machine, for example, in a 32-bit machine, this is a 5-bit field, this is a 5-bit field, this is a 5-bit field, I believe this is a 7-bit field, 5, 10, 15, maybe this is 6 bits. It might be 6 bits. I don't remember exactly, should have written that down. But I'm pretty sure this is 15, 25, 32, I think that's 7. And these are fives, and this is 15, 25, and 7 is 32. So you got 5, 10, 15, and 7 is 22, so these, there's just extra dead bits out here. They're not dead, they're just not looked at. So what happens is you read in the combination of logic, looks at the op code in the IR to decide how to interpret these fields. If it's a jump instruction, then I will interpret that big chunk of bits as being an offset. If it's an R-type, then I will interpret these pieces of the instruction regulations. as being addresses in the register file. [-2.84161549e-02 -5.14077879e-02  1.04435384e-02  1.12696588e-01\n",

Because, right, if I'm going to have a line size of four words, I can see. set up my machine to when I do a request, go out and get four words. Because that's my line size of my cache. So you just have to. OK, so we got that. This is kind of dull and dry at this point. But now we get into some interesting stuff. So there's various access methods. How do I access my memory? So there's sequential. which means I scan through memory until I hit the thing that I want. This is, it is laid out. Anybody know what sort of storage used that? No, the cache does not lay it out sequentially. This is more external, think, old sci-fi movies when you're going to show off your computer. What does your computer have?

So since your addresses are pointing to a spot in memory, there you go. It enables, so here's what we're going to have. Let's look at these things in more detail. there's two kinds of memory and that's lots of there's lots of there's this this is not quite correct but there are two kinds of memory static and dynamic I'm going to say There's all kinds, there's two kinds of memories, volatile and not volatile, there's two kinds of memory.

Yeah, there would be nothing because if you only have 128, or in this case, 64 bytes of memory, these two address lines don't matter. And in fact, that's how when your machine boots up, what it does is it runs through all of the addresses, writing and reading, until it gets to a set where when it rode out, it doesn't get back anything, and that's how it knows when the memory is ended. Because if you got a 64-bit address, you're not going to have 2 to the 64th. So you just plug along until suddenly when I did a store, nothing happened, and then I know that's the end of my memory. And this, again, I think I mentioned earlier, this is why some machines can only support 8 gigabytes. Other machines can support 16 gigabytes. It's all, how many of these decoded did they provide? If they only provided, you know, 5 to 32, then that's all the memory. You can only address 32 chips and you're done.\n",

The  aspect  of  memory  that relates  to  learning,  to  behavioral  learning. That's  what  we  call  implicit  memory. Implicit  memory,  I  think we're  going  to  get  into  that  at  some  point  very  briefly, but  it's  not  going  to  be  the  main  focus  of  the  course. Implicit  memory  is  the  ability to  retain  some  changes,  some  modifications. Behavior  that  arise  from  experience learning  that  we're  not  necessarily  aware  of  consciously. They  become  manifest  only  when  you  examine  the  behavior. Now  instead  of  that, what  we're  going  to  examine  is  explicit  memory. What  we  typically  called  memory. The  ability  to  retain  some  information, The  ability  to  retrieve,  to recollect  some  past  experiences,  and  so  on. Now,  in  the  history  of  memory, there  have  been  three  main  approaches and  I'm  going  to  present  them, starting  with  the  three  of  the  corresponding  individuals  who introduced  this  approaches  to memory  sues  that  made  a  big  difference. The  first  one  in  late  19th  century was  the  Herman  Ebbinghaus,  Germany. He  published  the  book  concerning  memory.\n",

Number  two,  there  will  be, there  must  be  some  correspondence  between the  type  of  memory  and  the  brain  system. And  not  all  types  of  memory  are  going  to  rely  on the  same  brain  system  that  led about  30  years  ago  to  the  taxonomy  of  memory  that  you  see  there. That  this  is  typically  still  used  extensively  to  this  day. Even  though  we  know  that  some  things in  this  taxonomy  are  inaccurate. We  have  updated  this  to  some  extent, but  it's  very  convenient  and  people  still  use  it. The  main  division  of  long  term  memory  that  what we  typically  called  memory  in everyday  life  is  between  explicit  and  implicit. Like  I  said,  also  called  declarative  and  non  declarative. Implicit  is  the  memory  that  you're  not  aware  of  necessarily, you  cannot  use  consciously.

Implicit  memory,  I  think we're  going  to  get  into  that  at  some  point  very  briefly, but  it's  not  going  to  be  the  main  focus  of  the  course. Implicit  memory  is  the  ability to  retain  some  changes,  some  modifications. Behavior  that  arise  from  experience learning  that  we're  not  necessarily  aware  of  consciously. They  become  manifest  only  when  you  examine  the  behavior. Now  instead  of  that, what  we're  going  to  examine  is  explicit  memory. What  we  typically  called  memory. The  ability  to  retain  some  information, The  ability  to  retrieve,  to recollect  some  past  experiences,  and  so  on. Now,  in  the  history  of  memory, there  have  been  three  main  approaches and  I'm  going  to  present  them, starting  with  the  three  of  the  corresponding  individuals  who introduced  this  approaches  to memory  sues  that  made  a  big  difference. The  first  one  in  late  19th  century was  the  Herman  Ebbinghaus,  Germany. He  published  the  book  concerning  memory.\n",

Yeah,  yeah,  so  she  has  a  fair  clarification  about  semantic  memory. And  semantic  memory  is  the  sort  of general  information  about  things  that  you  know. It's  not  about  a  particular  episode, about  a  particular  cat  that  you  remember. It's  just  the  general  memories  that  you have  about  the  category  of  cats. Okay. Does  that  make  sense? Yeah. Anything  else? Episodes, other  brain  processes  like  the  episode  itself? Yeah,  I  think  so. The  question  is,  could  you  have  sort  of  episodic  memories  that you're  actually  not  aware  of but  they  would  still  influence  your  behavior?

      "    Content: One just kind of thing to highlight is, anytime you're testing an animal for a strategy, so when you test, when you train animals on something, you train them with rewards when you want to test the animal to see what they remember you usually test them without a reward because there's all these problems with there could be smell of the reward or other things that are going on but then if you're actually more trying to understand what they're doing instead of just being sure then you would actually provide rewards steps that they keep investigating. So for this to be a perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect thing, you would have to remove all the rewards and just test it. Because the animal is going to behave based on what it expects to be happening and not what they can smell or other things that are going on. So the evidence supports this hypothesis. It seems that they remember positions of the by relating them to visible landmarks in the room. How could you have proved this even more? What is the experiment that I'm not showing you because it wasn't as though it was reading? Yeah, so here they move the landmarks and showed you that the animal kind of follows them.

So then when we started adding other orders, everything that was happening was completely different from what we had predicted would happen. And there's a very famous story in behavior of something known as Cleverhands. Clever Hans was a very famous horse that supposedly could actually count. He became famous enough. that they brought people scientists and behaviors from across the world to study him. At the University, we get the W. At the beginning of the 20th century, a horse in Germany rose to fame as he knew how to count and multiply and divide. This created a stir throughout Europe and people could not believe how impressive it was. At Adam Wise, he showed you the secret of clever hands, the mathematical clever hands and his owner, Bill Helm Bon Austin, were dedicated to giving shows so that everyone could see with their own eyes that this horse had exceptional qualities.

The last thing I'll say before we go is, are you familiar with clever hands? Raise your hand. Okay, counting horse, kind of. Okay, so one of the things about behavior is that animals are clever and animals are going to do whatever they want to do, not whatever you want them to do. So for example, we were doing this testing process where we wanted to train rats to go to the right if they smell order A and go to the left if they smell order B. We were trying to figure out how different the orders need to be for the animals to be able to discriminate them. Simple behavior. Your animal would go to the center, come out, A, and then we decided to change one of the orders for C. So radically, you should have disrupted completely the behavior because it's this new other, but the animal kept going A to the right, now C to the left. And we put D, D to the left. We changed A and the animal just went left.\n",
